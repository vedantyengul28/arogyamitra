## Problem Statement and Motivation üí°

When thinking about healthcare, several guiding questions arise: How can we provide patients with seamless access to their health records? How can we simplify the process of locating nearby hospitals and scheduling appointments? These questions lie at the core of creating a comprehensive Healthcare Management System.

Healthcare management is often seen as a challenging and fragmented process, but technology can transform it into a cohesive and efficient experience. By integrating features like hospital locators, health data storage, appointment scheduling, and secure access to medical records, we can bridge gaps in patient care and hospital management.

For instance, a hospital locator powered by real-time APIs can help patients in emergencies quickly find nearby facilities. Similarly, a robust health data storage system ensures that users have their medical history accessible anytime, anywhere, reducing delays in treatment. Appointment scheduling features can streamline booking consultations, allowing both patients and healthcare providers to focus on care delivery rather than administrative tasks.

By enabling data aggregation from multiple healthcare providers using advanced APIs, we can provide a centralized view of a patient‚Äôs health journey, enhancing decision-making for both patients and providers. Leveraging modern frameworks, tools, and technologies like scalable relational databases (Supabase) and Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ensures smarter, more interactive systems for exceptional user experiences.

## Architecture & Key Components üõ†Ô∏è

### Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
1. **User Query & Health Records**: Relevant portions of user health records and queries are embedded into a vector store (e.g., Pinecone).  
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Searches for closely matching documents in the vector store based on the query embedding.  
3. **Response Generation**: Combines query, documents, and health records for LLM (Language Learning Model) processing, ensuring accurate natural language responses.  
4. **Feedback Loop**: Incorrect or incomplete responses trigger interactions with a Health Information Search API to refine the result.  

### Medicine Reminders with Cron Jobs
- **Node.js cron** tasks run every minute to check for due reminders.  
- **Firebase Admin SDK** sends push notifications to user devices.  
- **Robust Error Handling:** Ensures seamless operation by handling timezone differences and retries.

### Appointments via NexHealth
- **NexHealth API**: Used for provider lookup, patient records, and appointment scheduling.  
- **Express.js Backend**: Synchronizes appointments with Supabase for a unified experience.  

### Medicine Price Comparison Scraper
- **Real-Time Scraping**: Fetches live medicine prices from multiple platforms.  
- **JSON Aggregation**: Standardizes data across different APIs for easy comparison.  

### Insurance Premium Predictor
- **Machine Learning Models**: LightGBM, Random Forest, and others are converted to ONNX for efficient deployment.  
- **ONNX Pipelines**: Standardizes preprocessing and prediction, ensuring real-time, scalable predictions.
